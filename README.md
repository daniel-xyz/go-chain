This is my personal project to get into the Go programming language (Golang). You should not use this Blockchain or Client, except you want to have some fun! 🤙

#### Checklist

- [x] Hash & verify blocks
- [ ] Add Blocks to Blockchain
- [ ] Validate Blockchain
- [ ] Real Mining with Dfficulty (nonce)
- [ ] Wallets/Balances
- [ ] Transaction Pool and P2P-Sync
- [ ] Web Interface/Electron App

#### Outlook

Eventually this client (or a fork from it) will become compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain as soon as the first prototype works with it's own (rather stupid) chain.

Have fun ❤️ and give feedback!
